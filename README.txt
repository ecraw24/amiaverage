CSPB 3308 Project Milestone 1: Project Proposal

Project Title: “Am I average?”
Github repository: https://github.com/ecraw24/CSPB3308_Project.git 
Github Usernames: ecraw24, michaelkimmer500, Masonmjeffrey, kvick27
Team members: Emma Crawford, Michael Kim, Jeff Mason, & Kevin Vick

Vision Statement 
The web application “Am I average?” will allow users to compare their performance to other users for a wide array of skills. From weightlifting to hula hooping to speed eating, users can enter their stats and compete against other users. The application will have a native collection of “averages” that are calculated from data on each skill, sourced from an organization with authority to create such data or standards (e.g., Major League Eating, The Hula Hoop Institute, etc.). In addition, users will be able to add their own categories and skills for other users to compete with. Each skill will have a title, description, measurement type, data source, and designated ranges for each skill level (e.g., novice, average, advanced, expert, etc.). 

Motivation
As students cloistered for almost two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realized a significant part of our lost identity stemmed from the inability to contrast achievements with peers. Whether for ego, wellbeing, study, or just entertainment, a mutual sense of juxtaposition is a grounding tenet of the human experience. Many individual sites and sources of information support particular aspects of this behavior, but do so disparately. Even social media, the ultimate freeform yardstick, only benchmarks informally and indiscriminately. By aggregating key curiosities on an open platform, data can be collected affirmatively and new questions can be structured according to user ambition. While self-reported and far from scientific, our goal is to develop a transparent environment such that neuroses are no longer forced to fester in silence.

Risks/Roadblocks 
Some members have not worked in a development team setting before
(Assuming we use Heroku) Need to become more familiar with tools we are using to develop the app
Not just Heroku platform, but also further familiarity with Git, etc.
Some/All (?) members do not have familiarity with front end languages like HTML, CSS, JS
Team members have other responsibilities and live in different time zones which can make it hard to meet often; most work would be done separately instead of together (i.e. no pair programming)
Have a vision of things we wish to include, but are unsure if we will be able to do so

Mitigation Strategies 
We vibe well together, so working together seems like it will be easier
In class, we will be learning front-end languages (or at least being introduced to them)
Increased usage of tools will lead to increased familiarity
Using Git/Github, we can easily merge our individual work into the master project (and it will be even more seamless if we work on completely different parts)
Team members agreed to set aside time at least once a week to meet together over zoom
We plan to start small, and build larger if possible

Development Method & Project Tracking Software
For Project Tracking we will utilize Github Projects instead of Trello
While Trello is a great platform, the 30 day free trial is a turn off: having limited functionality for part of/ the entirety of the project is undesirable
Github is fairly standard so the use and practice of it will be valuable going forward and there should be plenty of support for any problems that arise
Development Method will be a mix between Kanban and Scrum as a “Scrumban”
We will have defined roles like a Scrum Development setting
We will still have weekly Scrum meetings
Changes will be made constantly even during Sprints similar to Kanban
We will use a Kanban board for the added visual benefit of tracking our project status
Utilizing both of these will encourage transparency and adaptation while preserving efficiency

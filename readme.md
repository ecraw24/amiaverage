<h2> Vision Statement </h2>
The web application “Am I average?” will allow users to compare their performance to other users for a wide array of skills. From weightlifting to hula hooping to speed eating, users can enter their stats and compete against other users. The application will have a native collection of “averages” that are calculated from data on each skill, sourced from an organization with authority to create such data or standards (e.g., Major League Eating, The Hula Hoop Institute, etc.). In addition, users will be able to add their own categories and skills for other users to compete with. Each skill will have a title, description, measurement type, data source, and designated ranges for each skill level (e.g., novice, average, advanced, expert, etc.). 

<h2> Motivation </h2>

As students cloistered for almost two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realized a significant part of our lost identity stemmed from the inability to contrast achievements with peers. Whether for ego, wellbeing, study, or just entertainment, a mutual sense of juxtaposition is a grounding tenet of the human experience. Many individual sites and sources of information support particular aspects of this behavior, but do so disparately. Even social media, the ultimate freeform yardstick, only benchmarks informally and indiscriminately. By aggregating key curiosities on an open platform, data can be collected affirmatively and new questions can be structured according to user ambition. While self-reported and far from scientific, our goal is to develop a transparent environment such that neuroses are no longer forced to fester in silence.
